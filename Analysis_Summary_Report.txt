### METHODOLOGY

**Data Processing:**
1. Cleaned raw data and extracted year from DATE column
2. Parsed GOODS DESCRIPTION using regex patterns to extract:
   - Model names
   - Quantities (QTY:XXX PCS/SETS/NOS)
   - Unit prices (USD XXX PER)
3. Mapped HSN codes to descriptions and categories
4. Computed derived metrics (Grand Total, Per Unit Costs, Duty %, etc.)

**Key Formulas:**
- Grand Total_INR = TOTAL VALUE_INR + DUTY PAID_INR
- Duty % = (DUTY PAID_INR / TOTAL VALUE_INR) × 100
- YoY Growth % = (Current Year - Previous Year) / Previous Year × 100
- Per Unit Cost With Duty = Per Unit Cost + (Duty Paid / Quantity)

**Tools Used:**
- Python (pandas, openpyxl, regex)
- Microsoft Excel
- Data cleaning and transformation techniques
